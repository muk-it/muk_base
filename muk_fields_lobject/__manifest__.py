    "description": """ 
        Provides a field to store bytes as PostgreSQL
        large objects.
        
        PostgreSQL offers support for large objects,
        which provide stream-style access to user data
        that is stored in a special large-object structure.
        They are useful with data values too large to be
        manipulated conveniently as a whole.
